Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net write_24b/colour_decoder/counter/time_done__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin write_24b/colour_decoder/counter/time_done_reg_i_1/O, cell write_24b/colour_decoder/counter/time_done_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net write_24b/colour_decoder/rst2_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin write_24b/colour_decoder/rst_reg_i_2/O, cell write_24b/colour_decoder/rst_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net write_24b/counter/int_counter_reg[6]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin write_24b/counter/enable_reg_i_1/O, cell write_24b/counter/enable_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
